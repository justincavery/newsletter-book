# How to approach Sponsors

If there is a theme that runs along this short read then it’s “be open and transparent”.

I was initially tempted to fudge the numbers of subscribers, the open rate or the click rate when getting in touch with possible sponsors because I was afraid the newsletter wasn’t “rockstar” enough. Fortunately I didn’t and I encourage you to do the same and be open and transparent.

Sponsors are going to know exactly how well their spots are doing because they’ll be looking at the number of people arriving on their site and how many convert. By being honest you’ll avoid a really awkward conversation later on.

You should structure you email to possible sponsors you should include at a minimum: - Number of subscribers - Open rate - Click rate - Ad specifications \(more on that in a bit\)

Additional information that is helpful includes:

* Subscriber growth rate \(new subscribers each week\)
* Demographic breakdown by Country \(or by State if you are targeting within a Country and you can get the data\)

## Media Pack <a id="media-pack"></a>

A lot of sponsors like to review a media pack because that’s how the advertising world seems to work. Within the pack you can cover off some general information about the Newsletter, stuff like the topic, the frequency of sending, and the types of people that you are attracting. It should also contain some more specific information, the same as what I explained about sharing earlier including subscriber numbers, growth, open and click rates and demographic information. The Media Pack will also show examples of previous sponsors, and more specifically how they look within the newsletter and on the site and the specifications for each of the spots.

You might have more than one sponsor spot in the newsletter so showing how each look

## Sponsorship Ad Specifications <a id="sponsorship-ad-specifications"></a>

This is where you specify the details about the ad itself. I specify - Title \(80 Character Limit\) - Description \(250 - 350 characters\) - Image \(125x125 or 133x100, no animated gifs\) - Tracking link \(this is applied to the image, title and specified text within the description\)

As an added extra I try and share with each new sponsor any of the lessons that have been learned from previous editions. If a particular type of headline works better, the type of image, the length of text, or the offer itself \(discounts of more than 25% get more than 50% more clicks for example\).

You \(lost my train of thought\).
