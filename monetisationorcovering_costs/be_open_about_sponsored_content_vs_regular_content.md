# Be open about sponsored content vs regular content

There may be situations where you are approached by someone to have a sponsored feature article in the newsletter. These can be beneficial for the sponsors because they appear to be within the content and therefore are not met with any bias someone might have towards advertising.

This is your newsletter and contains content that you have custom picked… and people subscribe to it because they appreciate your thoughts and ideas on the subject. If you’re going to include sponsored posts you should always label them as such… Peter Cooper does this very well in his Javascript Weekly and HTML5 Weekly.
