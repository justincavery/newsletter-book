# It’s not all about the money

If you’re fortunate and you are able to cover your costs you can start looking at ways to improve your subscribers lives by forgoing the usual sponsor fees in exchange for discounts or give aways, or rewards for all of your hard work.

For example - “A Book Apart” provided me with an overly generous discount rate on their library for the readers in exchange for putting them in as a sponsor. - Beyond Tellerrand provided me with a ticket to attend their event in Dusseldorf, and later provided 2 tickets to give away to readers in Berlin - Smashing Magazine have provided several electronic and hard copies of their books to give away to the readers \(as well as provided copies to me as well\) and covered the shipping costs as well.

These give aways provide you the perfect platform to further promote your newsletter by asking people to tweet about why they want to win the giveaway and use both your own twitter handle and the sponsor in the process as well.

As you can see there are many ways to benefit from all that hard work toiling over content other than just the satisfaction in knowing that a few people are more educated after each email campaign.
