# Monetisation/or/Covering Costs

As your newsletter grows in popularity you will begin to find that the costs to maintain it grow. Once you reach more than 2000 subscribers on Mailchimp you will begin to pay a subscription costs based on the number of subscribers, where as Campaign Monitor charge from the beginning.

If you’re also running a website to support the content you are creating as we discussed in an earlier chapter there will be hosting and backup costs that come along with that as well.

If your newsletter is there to sell or promote other products you are providing then you have nothing to worry about, the email is just another one of your promotional channels \(along side paid search, social media, blogs etc\).

On the chance that you’re like me you started out with something you enjoyed doing and it turned into something that was costing you money then there are some ways to help.

* Include sponsorship options for your newsletter
* Provide advertising places on your website
* Sell something to your new army of subscribers
* Provide a patron option \(ongoing monthly payment\)
* Offer paid subscriptions to past content

What ever option you choose to take remember to keep your subscriber in the loop about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.

When the tipping point arrived I included the following in my emails

_\*_ Insert email that went out to subscribers about sponsorship

The important things to highlight with your audience are: - This is for sustainment, not profit - Not all sponsorship is approved, only things that you would otherwise recommend even if they weren’t a sponsor - There will only be X sponsors… try keep it to just one - Sponsor will be clearly marked so not to confuse with the regular content. - Please don’t ignore the sponsor, check out what they have to offer because they’re helping me to afford to produce and for you to receive the content.
