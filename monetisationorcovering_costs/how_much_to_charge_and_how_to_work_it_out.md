# How much to charge and how to work it out

The amount that you get for your sponsorship can depend on

* the type of content you send
* the frequency
* number of subscribers
* open and click through rate

I looked at a range of newsletters and sponsorship rates and worked on the basis of charging $0.02 per subscriber for each newsletter.

So when I reached 5000 subscribers I began asking for $100 to sponsor the newsletter each week, and then once it reached 10,000 subscribers that number went up to $200 per week.

I also worked on an in-kind basis whereby if the price went up and an existing/previous sponsor wanted to appear again they would be charged the original rate for the first week as a thank you.
