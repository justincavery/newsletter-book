# Campaign Monitor

Campaign Monitor is an Australian based company who have a very similar offering to Mailchimp. In fact they put as much effort into the layout and design of the interface and prebuilt email templates as Mailchimp as well.

Unfortunately Campaign Monitor don’t offer a free subscriber level, but they do make up for that by offering a white label solution if you’re part of an agency that would like to resell an email marketing tool to your clients.
