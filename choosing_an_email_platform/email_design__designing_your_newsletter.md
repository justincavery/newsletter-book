# Email Design / Designing your newsletter

Email templates are not like web pages. Sure, they both use HTML & styles to control the visual aspects of the page but the html that powers your email is something out of the late nineties: tables and inline styles FTW.

This doesn’t mean that you can’t use some important modern day techniques: Responsive Design for example is something you can still take advantage, although there are some caveats with support for certain mail clients. As with building websites you want to build your email from a mobile first approach so that people reading the content on the mobile are just as happy as someone receiving it on the desktop… the first media query is the absence of any media query.

This isn’t a tutorial on HTML email development though, but if you’re interested in how to create on from scratch check out.

## Predefined Email Templates <a id="predefined-email-templates"></a>

Mail chimp and Campaign Monitor both come with predefined templates that allow you to easily switch out a logo, change the typeface, alter the colour scheme and upload your own images and content. Both also have email building tools which allows you even further control over what is include as part of your email, featuring drag and drop capabilities.

## Build your own with an email frameworks <a id="build-your-own-with-an-email-frameworks"></a>

Email frameworks are a pre-canned set of HTML and CSS that have been developed to make the creation of you email templates much easier. If you’ve heard of Curb Foundation or Twitter Bootstrap then think those but for emails.

In fact, the helpful team at Zurb created an email framework to go along with foundation called Zurb Ink.

Some templates you can look at include:

* Zurb Ink: A partner for Foundation, if you’re using this in your site you will be able to port the same Sass across for the template \(but be warned, it needs to go inline\) UPDATE
* Antwerp: UPDATE
* Responsive Email Designer \(paid software from CoffeeCup\)
