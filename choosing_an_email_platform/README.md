# Choosing an email platform

Email can become very spammy so you donâ€™t really want to roll your own email campaigns sent out from your gmail account.

There are some great tools including Mailchimp and Campaign Monitor that take all of the heartache out of email campaigns and provide a easy to use interface to create lists, design email templates, create campaigns and report on the results.
