# Twitter \(lists, searches\)

The first thing you should do is set up a Twitter account for your email. This will allow you to connect with your possible audience before they provide you with their email address and will allow you to showcase that you have something to say.

This twitter account will allow you to:

* Engage with your audience on a more frequent basis
* Follow industry leaders in your field/area of expertise
* Re-publish newsletter content
* Provide a one click sign up facility for the newsletter \(covered later in Building your Audience\)

The more people you follow the wider you will be casting your net to catch some great content, but also the more content you will be required to review and curate.

Now that we know why Twitter, lets look at ways to set up Twitter.

Head over to twitter and sign up, and as part of the signup process you’re going to need an email that hasn’t already got a twitter account assigned to it. The easiest approach is to create a new Gmail account, however you could also sign up using your existing gmail address along with +newsletter, for example myemail+newsletter@gmail.com is considered a new email by twitter, but all emails will go to your regular myemail@gmail.com account. Neat!

For the RWD Weekly email I have set up @rewswebdes and every morning I switch over to that account on my Twitter client and look through all of the posts to identify anything worth opening in the browser for a closer look, or engage in the conversations that are going on.

It is important to also contribute posts on a frequent basis and I often tweet the links I have gathered for RWD Weekly the week after they are featured in the newsletter. This helps share valuable content and pick up more followers and provides an extra reason to subscribe and get the links sooner with a longer description in the weekly newsletter.

Ironically this has ended up with my newsletter Twitter following being 3 times larger than my own… but then that is also a good sign that you are posting the right stuff.

If you happen to be sending the newsletter from your own personal brand and would rather not clog up your twitter feed with a tonne of followers you can also create Twitter lists to follow certain people/accounts without interrupting your regular feed. This will still allow you to Favourite and Retweet great things you find but will help build up a social profile to promote yourself more than the newsletter itself — the key is to make sure you understand the pros and cons for each and choose the one that matches your goals.

A twitter list needs a name and a description, and you need to decide if it’s going to be private or public. Public lists can be subscribed to by others so I personally think that’s the best option \(sharing is _always_ the best option\). Then you need to search for the people you want to follow, and instead of clicking on follow click the gear/settings icon instead and tick the list you would like to use.

Twitter Searches is another way that will display tweets specifically about the topic you’re interested in. As with most things on the web you need to be aware that really popular topics are often picked up by “content marketers” who want to ride on the coat tails of that popularity, so keywords will often result in 99% rubbish and 1% quality. My tip is find the 1% and follow that person \(or add them to your list\).
