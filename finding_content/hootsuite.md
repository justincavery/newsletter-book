# Hootsuite

[Hootsuite](https://github.com/justincavery/5ss/tree/4ce83541953acc0f4682225d9809022f03cf3c57/finding_content/hootsuite.com) is a paid for service, USD$5.99 p/m, that allows you to create streams of social content. This can be done with Twitter Lists, but I like the ability to see all my social channels, hashtags and searches in the one interface.

Hootsuite allows you to pull through Google Plus, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube all within a single Dashboard view, and you can set up as many dashboards and streams as you need. You can have single hash tag searches, I use \#rwd, or you can set up a search across a number of different terms by including a pipe \(\|\) in between each term â€” CSS3 Grid\|Mobile Design\|Media Queries.

This is where I would pick up the majority of my links that come through social media because I visit it the most after my twitter feeds. It also comes in handy to monitor questions and mentions from the newsletters social channels to keep a regular conversation going with the readers/subscribers.

Hootsuite is a robust Social Media platform and covering off all of it's uses is outside the scope of this short read. For more information on
