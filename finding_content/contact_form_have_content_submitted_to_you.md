# Contact form… have content submitted to you.

Once you become established with a regular newsletters and build a good core group of subscribers you will find some content being suggested or recommended directly to you through email. A warm heartfelt THANK YOU to all subscribers that take the time to do this.

To help get this going I occasionally include something like “If you’ve come across an article/tutorial/framework that you have found useful then please hit reply and let me know so we can share it with everyone, it’ll only take you 2 minutes”. The idea is that you want people to know that it's okay to email links they find, but in particular content that they create.

Once you open this relationship up you need to nurture it as well. Include the links that are great, and if you don't think they're up to scratch to include in your publication then offer some advice and explanation around why you are not using it. Alternatively suggest the things you would like to see added/improved to get it to the stage where you _would_ included it.

You can also look to include a submission form in the same way that Sascha Grief does on Sidebar.io. One thing to remember when going down this route is to always credit the contributor… not only is it good manners but it makes them feel a part of the newsletter and encourages other people to submit content as well.

The key with this approach is you want people to suggest their own content. It's likely that something they come across themselves will already be found in your other content channels, but the real nugget of gold will be from themselves.
