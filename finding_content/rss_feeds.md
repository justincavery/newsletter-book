# RSS Feeds

I keep a list of my favourite blogs that continually produce great content. These include online magazine style publications like Smashing Magazine and A List Apart and extend to individual blogs like Ethan Marcotte and Brad Frost.

These lists get pulled through into Feedly and I read them offline using Reeder on my commute to and from work on the London Tube.

The biggest benefit of RSS feeds is that you can the same content without having to remember all of the different sites you like to visit. It also keeps an offline version for you to read, and the content is laid out sans design with a focus on readability.

The more feeds you can include in your list the more content you will have to wade through, so I often find a bit of RSS tidying every few months helps keep things fresh and relevant.
