# Google Alerts

[Google alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) are a great way to find some hidden gems in the plethora of pages that live on the Google index, however like the twitter search there is a lot of rubbish that comes through this channel if you've got a term that is "in vogue".

If you’re targeting a popular topic there is a good chance that people are trying to score high for that topic in SEO. This also means that every Tom, Dick and Harry will litter their content with keywords, often on articles that are not worth sharing. The knock on effect of this technique is that you will be getting lots of alerts with little quality.

Setting up an alert is very similar to performing a standard Google search, except instead of always getting back the most popular posts you get back any posts that have been recently published and/or indexed by Google.

Google Alerts does have a feature to try and combat that through a “Not Interested” link at the bottom of each of their emails.

Using the link should help improve the results over time but I’ve found that it doesn’t work very well \(I’m still getting alerts from PR companies even though I ignore every one\).

The alert search criteria accepts the same arguments as regular searches as well, so if you are getting some spammy results you can customise your query as time goes on. For example my search is

> Responsive web design

Using search operators I can update that to be

> Responsive web design -PR -"press release"

This will now ignore any results that contain the terms PR, and "press release" is in quotes so that it matches that exact phrase rather than ignoring the single words press and relase. You can also ignore entire sites by including

> Responsive web design -PR -"press release" -site:prweb.com/

There's a whole page dedicated to [Google search operators](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en), and as you update your Alert you will see a preview of the type of content that you will be getting emailed to ensure you're not removing anything valuable.

At the end of the day I would rather get too many alerts and flag them as not relevant then set up too many filters and miss something important. The alerts to manage to find me at least one gem every other week so it's a worthwhile channel. Once you _do_ find a gem I'd advise you to find the RSS feed for that site and add it to your RSS reader.

I hope that after seeing all the spam through this approach you will be extra direven to create _quality_ content on your own website or newsletter site.
