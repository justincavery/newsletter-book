# Zite/Flipboard

Zite, or as an alternative Flipboard \(although Flipboard have recently acquired Zite\), is an application that will share content from popular websites. This has a thumbs up/down option that works really well, so the more often and longer you use it for the more targeted and better the suggestions.

Where Zite differs from Flipboard is it is designed to find the content that is OUTSIDE of your regular networks. For me itâ€™s the best tool to find the hidden gems.

 **come back to this page - Zite has closed and I need to include a suitable alternative**
