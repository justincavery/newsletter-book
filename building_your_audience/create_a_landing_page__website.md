# Create a Landing Page / Website

Now that you’ve got your form it’s time to give it a home so you can begin to drive traffic towards it and grow your list.

The landing page should be short and snappy and cover a few key messages.

* Tell them why the newsletter will benefit them
* Tell them how often you’ll be emailing them
* Reassure them you won’t be spamming/selling their emails
* Show them what their peers are saying about your emails

The peer reviews are wonderful because it gives people confidence that others have found it useful… and lets face it we like to know that someone else has already bought in and it’s safe. If you’re just starting out with a newsletter you will need to wait a little while before this is available, but it’s worth pursuing once you begin to build up a community.

You don’t need to overthink the platform here either if you’re just using it as a landing page and nothing else, but if you’ve already gone to the trouble of setting it up it’s worth spending a little bit more time on this and building it on something that can be a home for the archive of all your newsletters. This approach will mean that late comers can browse through your past editions and catch up on what’s been happening and you will improve your placement on Google as you will be posting regular interesting content.

The most common options include:

* Wordpress - RDWeekly and WDWeekly
* GitHub - Dev Ops Weekly and Web Platform Daily
* Squarespace

Don’t let the lack of a landing page stop you. Stu Robson from Sass Weekly is still going at 500+ users and still doesn’t have a website landing page, Stu directs people to the Mailchimp signup form directly through articles on his blog and Twitter. Cooper Press only uses previous editions listed through Mailchimp whereas RWD weekly and WDWeekly have dedicated sites.

Now that we have somewhere to subscribe and keep our archives it’s time to turn our attention to the email design… something fraught with quirks and dangers.
