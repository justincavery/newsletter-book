# Ask people to share, auto post to Facebook/Twitter, Create a twitter card for subscriptions easy one

If you’re looking to send emails there’s a good chance that you’ve also got a Facebook page and a Twitter account. Depending on whether the email is coming from yourself, Justin Avery, or the newsletter, Responsive Design Weekly, you might want to create a branded Twitter and Facebook account specifically for them \(as well as a Google Plus account as a minimum… we’ll call them the Big 3\). You can go as far as also including a Instagram, Youtube/Vimeo, LinkedIn group or others depending on where your audience spends their time.

These social channels provide you an avenue to share your daily/weekly/fortnightly/monthly email through once you’ve added it to your website, although make sure you wait a few days after sending it to do that so that your subscribers are getting the content earlier \(and encourage others to sign up for premium access\).

You can also drip feed some of the links through the Big 3 as well so there’s a constant feed of content. The more this occurs the more followers you will receive, which means the more likes and shares you’ll get, which will in turn provide you with more subscribers. Synergy.
