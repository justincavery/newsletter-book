# Create a signup form \(every extra piece of information you ask is another barrier to them subscribin

Remember that people are very careful on what they share online and the more questions you ask, and therefore the more

Signup forms are created within your email provider of choice. An important consideration when creating your signup form is what your end goal is for your emails. What are the kinds of things you want to do with your list of users.

The minimum amount of information you need to collect as part of your email signup form is an email address, but if you’re looking to welcome them by their name then you also want to collect that as well. If you have a requirement to address them by their first and/or last name you want to provide first name and surname fields to be completed. Lets say you also provide a nice “Happy Birthday” email to your subscribers, now you need their date of birth as well. Are you looking to customise your emails based on the users preferences, well now you also need to collect those preferences as well.

The information you want to collect up-front should be weighed that up against the ease at which someone can complete the signup process. There’s no sense in requiring 10 pieces of information from your users and losing 90% of your potential customers because the signup process is too complicated.

If you do want too much up front you might look at building up a profile of your users over time by inviting them to update additional details AFTER they’ve been signed up for a while.

Once you’ve decided on the information you will be collecting from the user you can include these fields within your subscription form. The form will now be ready and usually comes in a few different formats _\*_ Add in general rules for this rather than mail chimp specific rules. compare against the campaign monitor options.

* Standalone - hosted by Mailchimp
* Copy/Paste with inline Mailchimp styles
* Naked — only the HTML relying on your styling skills
* Naked is the way to go for me \(stop your giggling please\) because it will inherit your existing site style guides and fit a little better.
