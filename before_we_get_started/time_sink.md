# Time sink

The amount of time that you will spend on your newsletter each week is going to depend on how organised you are, how much research you are already putting in to the topic, and your process/workflow.

On average I spend around 30-60 minutes a day reading a researching and another 3 hours on Thursday evenings putting the newsletter together to send out.

This is just a guide but an important one. It is important to understand the time you will need to commit to ensure you remain consistent, so you might want to think through the frequency of sending each newsletter and take care to not over commit initially.

A newsletter that goes from monthly to fortnightly will be seen as a success, whereas one that goes from weekly to monthly will be seen as something on the decline or not as important.
