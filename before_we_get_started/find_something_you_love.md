# Find something you love

> Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. Confucius

A wonderful sentiment that a lucky few of us can live by, but in the case of starting a newsletter it is certainly one we can take heed.

The simplest way to ensure that obstacle's like time, effort, and consistency are not things you need to worry about is to find something you _love_ doing and have a passion in.

This will help you still get something out the door and remain consistent when youâ€™ve had a crappy week, you/your partner and/or the kids are sick, you have a deadline for work, or your on holiday.

Love it!
