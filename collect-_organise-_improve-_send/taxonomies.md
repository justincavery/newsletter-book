# Taxonomies

Before I do what I do today I spent a few years managing information for a Utility that provided Power, Water and Sewage services. The company provided these services in it’s entirety, so in an Electricity example they generated the electricity, networked the electricity around the area, managed the facilities that delivered them, and sold them to both the general public and business. Each of those business areas had their own set of content and information that they needed to manage within the confines of what they did, but they also shared information between units. Then when you add Corporate functions on top of that \(like IT, Comms, Information Management\) you’ve all of a sudden got a lot of information and data that needs to be shared across a wide number of business and people that is easy to find. Essentially you all need to be speaking the same language, or singing from the same hymm sheet.

This common language is what I refer to as a taxonomy. It is a fixed way of describing similar content, or data, in a consistent way so that when you need to find a piece of information you have a programmatic way of achieving it.

You are probably already thinking of ways that you can split things up in ways that make sense. I split up sections of the newsletter in to

* Headline
* Article
* Tools
* Frameworks
* Tutorials
* Plugins
* Podcasts
* Jobs

That would be my regular segments for each week, but I add another segment for the topic as well which looks something like - media-queries - responsive-images - performance - sass - javascript

Take a look at the existing content that you have and want to start sharing with your readers and being to think about ways that you can break them up into taxonomies and later in this chapter we’re going to look at how that becomes even more useful soon.

For now, lets look at some tools that might help you doing the categorisation.
