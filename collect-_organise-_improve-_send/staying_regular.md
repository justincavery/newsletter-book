# Staying regular

I’ve always found that a good healthy variety of fruit and bran will keep your regular, however as for newsletters you’re going to need to put a little bit more thought into it.

Consistency is key in keeping readers opening your emails and engaging with you on a weekly/fortnightly/monthly basis. By keeping your emails regular you will end up becoming part of your readers routines and become something they will look forward to receiving.

With this goal it is important that you never miss an email. If this short read has you excited and ready to start sending daily emails that is GREAT, but don’t over commit yourself when you first start. You are better to start off with monthly or fortnightly emails and increase the frequency over time if you find the readers wanting more rather then aim for weekly emails and continually miss the deadline.

At the time of writing this RWD Weekly has been running for 182 weeks, which equates to more than 500 hours of work. In that time I’ve missed 3 emails however I’ve always sent something… even if it was to say I was going to be missing the email that week.

While it will depend on the tone of your emails and how much personality you want to give them, but whenever I’ve missed them I’ve included a brief note as to why whether it’s been due to being births, deaths or marriage.

To maintain this run I’ve had to give up a lot of Thursday nights but also I’ve worked on producing special editions of the newsletter including an Interview Series and Website Case Studies that allow me to line up a few in advance during the holiday periods.

## Interview Series <a id="interview-series"></a>

These can provide insights into your topic from other thought leaders in your industry and can be prearranged weeks or months before they are needed. If you’ve been running the newsletter for a little while the chances are that the people that you’re going to be looking to get in touch with will already be familiar with your work, and be honoured to help contribute towards sharing helpful content.

If you are using these newsletters as a way to sell things then make sure you’re upfront with the folks you’re asking to contribute. If you’re going to be making money out of their contributions then you need to be transparent and get their permission… better yet you can pay them an honorarium.

By approaching people in an honest and open way there’s not going to be any surprises and I found that only one person ever turned down the offer.

## Best of… <a id="best-of"></a>

This is not a listicle — 5 easy ways to be amazing — but instead a feature edition where you repeat a set of content that you’ve shared in the past. These are great in the lead up to Holidays because people tend to have more time on their hands to re-review things they didn’t have time to in the past, and also you can have some well deserved time off from research.

They might be the most clicked on articles for the year \(Campaign Monitor and Mailchimp offer these statistics\), or you might feature a particular angle for the week. In my case this might be Javascript Plugins, or Responsive Frameworks, or Tutorials on Flexbox. You already have the bookmarks and they’re well labeled/tagged with your taxonomy \(RIGHT!\) so it’s a breeze to put them together with little effort.

## Taking a break <a id="taking-a-break"></a>

Sometimes you will just need a break. We all have things that require our attention more than newsletter subscribers. Travel, work, stress, birthdays, births, deaths and marriages… You will have built up a rappore with your subscribers by now and they’re human just like you and understand we all need a break sometimes. Again, like most things I’ve said, just be as honest and transparent as you feel you can be and you’ll be surprised just how caring a bunch of people you have found. For example when I lost a good friend of mine to stress and wanted to take a couple of weeks off I was very transparent and asked that if people were also suffering from stress to feel free to open up. That resulted in more than 200 personal responses ranging from a few words of condolence & thanks for the past newsletters to hundreds of words of someones similar story.
