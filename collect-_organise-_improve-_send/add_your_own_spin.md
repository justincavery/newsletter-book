# Add your own spin

When it comes to writing the introduction to your newsletter or adding brief description against each of the links you should do so in your own words, in your own style/tone of voice.

A lot of people get nervous about this approach and just want to copy and paste the introduction from the beginning of the article or tool that you happen to be sharing. That’s okay if that’s what your format is going to be like, but one of the most frequent compliments I receive is that people enjoy hearing about my week, what I learned, and my opinions on a particular subject. It helps add a personal touch to your content and build a loyalty amongst your subscribers, and while it might put off a small number you’re going to have a stronger core group of readers because of it.
