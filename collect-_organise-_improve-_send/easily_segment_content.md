# Easily segment content

Once you’ve tagged up for for a week/fortnight/however frequent your emails are it’s time to segment them up.

You’ve already tagged all of the links with the name and edition so you segment by that to start with getting a list of all the content you’re sending.

From there you can segment them into your newsletter sections, headline, article, tutorial, tools etc and copy those details across to you email campaign tool of choice.

At this point I also update the tags applied to the bookmark, changing the rwd184 to be just 184 and therefore removing it from my segmented list \(as I’ve just added it\). I also add a tag called ‘newslettered’ which lets me know that it’s gone out previously. Sometimes I decide not to include a pice of content so I will tag it with ‘not-included’ and write a description around why it was left out. Sometimes it’s because there’s too much of the same content, sometimes because I feel it’s pushing the wrong message and other times because the page contains too much advertising of popups that I think is overly onerous on the subscriber to access the content. The key take away is that people are looking for you to provide the cream of the crop, the creme de-le creme, the ants pants, the bees-knees… they want what matters.
