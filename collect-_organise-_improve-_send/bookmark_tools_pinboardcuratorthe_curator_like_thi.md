# Bookmark tools \(Pinboard/Curator/the curator like thing\)

These tools are simply an online version of your browser bookmarks but much much better because you can access them from anywhere and they have better segmentation capabilities.

I was an avid user of Del.ici.ous however I eventually landed on using Pinboard created by Marek blah blah blah _**Add name**_

There are other options including - Curator - Delicious - Pinboard - add - more - examples

but the important thing to look for when deciding which to use is that it needs to be able to

* Store a URL
* Store a title
* Include a description
* Add multiple tags
* Allow you to segment by multiple tags
* Provide segmented tags in an RSS/XML/json feed
* Allow a bookmarklet to easily tag the current page your viewing
