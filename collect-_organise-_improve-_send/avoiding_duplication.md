# Avoiding Duplication

Over time, as you move from tens to hundreds to thousands of pieces of content, and as your newsletter grows from edition 1 to 10 to 100 you’re likely to come across the same piece of content that you previously shared.

To do this I follow a simple rule when selecting a link to use.

* Click bookmark
* Add the taxonomy \(headline, patterns, navigation\)
* Add the edition of the newsletter prefixed with the newsletter name \(rwd184 = Responsive Design Weekly edition 184\)
* Write a description about what the content is about

When using pinboard if I select a link that I’ve used in the past it will appear with some existing taxonomy already tagged, but there’s a little more you can do to help yourself here as well.
