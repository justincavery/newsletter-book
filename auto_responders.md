# Auto Responders

Auto responders are emails that are sent out to your subscriber based on a set of conditions. These conditions are triggered by the information you hold about your subscriber. Some examples of auto responders include

* **Welcome Email**: generated a few hours after confirming your subscription
* **Thank you email**: generated 1 year after initially subscribing, kind of as an anniversary present.
* **Engagement email**: If a users engagement ranking \(in mail chimp they use a 5 star rating\) drops below a certain level you might reach out for feedback.
* **Update details**: If a subscriber updates their contact details with more information, lets say they add their Twitter account, you could email them to suggest your own twitter feed.

Auto responders are a great way to set the tone and expectations of your newsletter with you newly engaged subscriber. They will have most likely signed up via your website so they will have a good indication about what to expect, but this is really your second chance to make a good first impression.
