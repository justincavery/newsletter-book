# Things not to do

## Evil popup… please please please love me <a id="evil-popup-please-please-please-love-me"></a>

If you are building a website along side of your email newsletter then do me a favour… please please please don’t include one of those popups that ask people to subscribe. I call it the Evil Popup.

The evil popup appears when you least expect it, and when you least need it. Lets take a quick look at when the evil popup rears it’s ugly head: - As soon as you visit the site, stopping you from reading the content - When you are half way through the article, stopping you from reading the content - As you mouse towards the top of the page to close the tab, stopping you from leaving after not enjoying the content

Ok… I admit that statistics show that the evil popup increases the number of people that subscribe to your list, however I’m not sure if they’ve ever then mapped subscribers that have signed up this way against the length of the subscription or the interaction with your emails \(open rates, forwards, clicks\).

If you’re directing traffic to your site to gain subscribers then send them to your home page and make the subscriptions form fro and centre. If users are arriving on the site through a search engine result then invite them to subscribe to your newsletter at the BOTTOM of the article. If you’ve written it well \(and it sounds like you have if you’ve ranked well for search\) then they’re going to want to know more about what you write and therefore more likely to subscribe.
