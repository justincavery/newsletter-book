# Building a Newsletter

As much as we pretend to hate email, we secretly still love it. It is 07:35am and as I walk onto the coach of the train I pass 13 people who are in the middle of reading their emails. iPads, Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy, iPhone 5/6, BlackBerry, and laptops… all with their list of emails to read. Like it or not, email is still the number one way to get your message out to interested readers.

I do love email… really. I love every Tuesday when I get my CSS email, every Thursday night when I receive my Web Developer Weekly and Web Tools Weekly. Most of all I love the whooshing sound and the picture of Freddy, the MailChimp chimp mascot, giving me a high five as I send out the Responsive Design Weekly email every Thursday night.

These weekly emails are a great way to provide content around a specific topic, and you should look at it as privilege that someone is inviting you into their personal space. You have been given the opportunity to share something important and informative with them… something that is going to influence the way they spend the day, or perhaps help put changes to their workflow for life.

Email is still the most useful way to share information with people, and to tell a story about what is happening in the world and how they can follow your words of wisdom.
